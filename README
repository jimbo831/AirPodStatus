This is a simple Python script that uses the Best Buy developer APIs to see if a product is available to order online or pickup in a nearby store.

It uses Instapush to provide push notifications via iOS or Android and requires the InstapushPython wrapper module:

Instructions

Get a Best Buy API key at https://developer.bestbuy.com
Sign up with an Instapush account (or modify the code to alert you some other way if you prefer)
Copy the bestbuy_product_status.py file and sample_properties.py file to a computer with Python installed.
Fill out the information on the properties file and rename it properties.py.
Use your OS to schedule bestbuy_product_status.py to run as often as you like.  I set mine to run every 15 minutes.

The application will notify you anytime a sku on your list is available to purchase online or in a store.
It is configured to ignore items that are on backorder or pre-order.
